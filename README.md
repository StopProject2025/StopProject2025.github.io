## Project 2025: Secret Training Videos Exposed

This repository contains over 14 hours of never-before-published videos from Project 2025's Presidential Administration Academy, obtained by [ProPublica and Documented](https://www.propublica.org/article/video-project-2025-presidential-training-academy-trump-election). These videos provide a chilling glimpse into the secretive effort to train a cadre of conservative loyalists to take over the federal government and implement a radical agenda.

**Project Overview:**

Project 2025 is a massive policy initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and its allies, aiming to prepare a "comprehensive blueprint" for a future conservative president to "deconstruct the administrative state" and implement a sweeping conservative agenda. The Presidential Administration Academy is one of the "four pillars" of this plan, designed to train potential political appointees to be "ready on day one."

**Video Content:**

The videos feature presentations and discussions by prominent conservative figures, including former Trump administration officials, Heritage Foundation experts, and leaders of other right-wing organizations. They cover a wide range of topics, including:

* **Conservative Principles and Ideology:**  Laying the groundwork for a conservative worldview and attacking "liberal" and "woke" ideas.
* **The Role of Political Appointees:**  Emphasizing the importance of loyal appointees in implementing the President's agenda and overcoming bureaucratic resistance.
* **Presidential Transitions and Appointee Hiring:**  Providing practical advice on how to get a job in a conservative administration and navigate the transition process.
* **Federal Background Checks and Security Clearances:**  Explaining the vetting process for potential appointees and how to avoid being disqualified.
* **The "Deep State" and the Federal Workforce:**  Instilling distrust of career civil servants and encouraging appointees to "watch the watchers" and to "rein in" the bureaucracy.
* **Policymaking and Regulatory Processes:**  Explaining how to develop and implement conservative policies, roll back regulations, and use executive power to advance the President's agenda.
* **Working with Congress and Building Coalitions:**  Providing strategies for working with Congress, building coalitions with outside groups, and navigating the political process.
* **Media Relations and Social Media Messaging:**  Advising appointees on how to interact with the media, bypass mainstream outlets, and use social media to promote a conservative message.
* **Government Oversight and Investigations:**  Explaining how to handle government oversight and investigations, including public records requests and congressional inquiries.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Trump's Influence:**  Despite Donald Trump's efforts to disavow Project 2025, most of the speakers in the videos have previously worked for the former president or have close ties to his administration.
* **Radical Agenda:**  The videos reveal a radical agenda to transform the federal government, dismantle the "administrative state," and implement a sweeping conservative ideology across all areas of government.
* **Secretive Training:**  The existence of these videos highlights the secretive nature of Project 2025 and its efforts to prepare for a conservative takeover of the government.

**Call to Action:**
